The Model S was officially announced on June 30, 2008, and a prototype vehicle was unveiled in March 2009. The Model S debuted on June 22, 2012. A revised, dual-motor, all-wheel-drive version, known as the 60D, debuted on October 9, 2014. The 60D was followed by the 70D, which made dual-motor and all-wheel drive the standard, followed by the 85D, P85D, and P90D. Along with these updates, Tesla offered the Autopilot driving assistance system. In April 2016, the Model S was updated with a new front hood design. In October of the same year, hardware became standard that supports Tesla's Full Self Driving (FSD) capability. As part of the update, integrated standard cameras around the car were added. In February 2017 the Tesla Model S P100D debuted, which included a revised motor and was the first electric vehicle to have an EPA estimated range exceeding 300 miles (483 km). A refresh of the Tesla Model S, codenamed \"Palladium\", was introduced in June 2021, offering a new \"Plaid\" performance model, along with a revised interior, powertrain, and suspension."

It shares an estimated 75 percent of its parts with the Tesla Model 3, which includes a similar interior and exterior design and electric powertrain. The Model Y fills a smaller and less expensive segment than the mid-sized Tesla Model X. Like the Model X, the Model Y offers optional third-row seats for a seven-passenger seating capacity."

      "description": "The 2022 Audi S5 Sportback looks great, goes fast, and carves corners as well as today's best sports sedans, but its anodyne driving persona lacks some of the charm and drama we look for in a performance car. Under the hood is a perky 349-hp turbocharged V-6 that sends its power through an eight-speed automatic down to the ground through standard Quattro all-wheel drive. Handling is lithe, and the S5 Sportback is easy to hustle down a twisty road.  Displacing 3.0 liters, the turbo V-6 is more powerful and torquier than the supercharged engine that came in the last-generation S5. It accelerates rapidly from a stop, and overtaking other drivers on the highway is effortless. While it trails the Mercedes-AMG C43's 4.1-second zero-to- 60 mph time, the last S5 model we tested still managed an impressive 4.3-second sprint. The EPA estimates the 2022 S5 Sportback will earn 21/30mpg city/highway. While we haven't tested a 2022 S5 Sportback on our real-world highway fuel-economy route, the last one we evaluated returned 33 mpg during that test."

The V8 sounds fantastic and has tons of power. At night the headlights are so bright its like driving during the day. The air conditioned seats make it sound like your flying in a pressurized cabin on a commercial flight. Now driving is the most relaxing part of my day. Ive put 15K miles on it in 11 months and no issues thus far. The amount of compliments I get on the truck is surprising. If your considering buying one, stop reading these reviews and go to the dealership and cut a check. You wont regret it, I promise.  ",

Slotted above the Wildtrak appearance package, the Raptor is fitted with suspension and chassis upgrades to improve its off-road capability. In line with its F-150 namesake, the Raptor is fitted with a widened track and a raised ride height.The Ranger Raptor is fitted with a 2.0L EcoBlue biturbo diesel engine, producing 210 hp. Shared with globally-marketed versions of the Ford Transit and the Ford Everest, the engine is coupled to a 10-speed automatic transmission (shared with the F-150, including the Raptor). Similar to F-150 Raptor, the four-wheel drive system of the Ranger Raptor is adaptable to terrain.While not wide enough to require clearance lights, the Ranger Raptor adopts several design elements of its F-150 counterpart, including gray six-spoke wheels, a FORD-lettered grille, and large Raptor decals on the sides of the cargo bed."

That's exactly what tens of thousands (maybe more) of Jeep Wrangler owners have been doing for nearly four decades to get the Wrangler of their dreams. What is that dream Wrangler, you ask? It's one with a V-8 engine under the hood. Jeep has never offered it as an option from its factory … until now. In grand fashion, Jeep chose not just any V-8 engine for its new 2022 Wrangler Rubicon 392, instead they grabbed the largest displacement engine in their catalog, the 6.4-liter HEMI V-8, and stuffed it between the Wrangler's fenders. When paired with the legendary off-road hardware of Jeep's Rubicon package, and the company's new Xtreme Recon package, it's not difficult to see how the Wrangler Rubicon 392 found itself on the top of our leaderboard, eventually taking home the title of the 2022 Four Wheeler SUV of the Year."

The styling of the original Supra was derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was both longer and wider.Starting in mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a separate model from the Celica. In turn, Toyota also stopped using the prefix Celica and named the car Supra. Owing to the similarity and past of the Celica's name, it is frequently mistaken for the Supra, and vice versa. The first, second and third generations of the Supra were assembled at the Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi, while the fourth generation was assembled at the Motomachi plant in Toyota City. The 5th generation of the Supra is assembled alongside the G29  Z4 in Graz, Austria by Magna Steyr."

      "description": "Whether it’s crunching through dense forest trails or quietly idling up to a Wendy’s drive-thru window, the four-wheel-drive Ford Bronco is arguably the most exciting off-roader since the Jeep Wrangler. The Bronco comes in both two- and four-door body styles, and it was designed to do everything a Wrangler can—and it does that and more. Yes, you can remove the doors on the Bronco just like you can on a Wrangler but only the Ford retains its mirrors. Both brands’ SUVs cater to the big muddy but the Bronco suffers from noticeably less road noise when traveling the highways between puddles. It has more base horsepower too, with output ranging between a 300-hp turbocharged 2.3-liter inline-four and a 330-hp twin-turbo 2.7-liter V-6. If you’re after more than that, feast your eyes on the swollen fenders of the 418-hp Bronco Raptor, reviewed separately. With a dizzying array of models, trims, and optional equipment the Bronco offers vast configurability that allows it to fit a wide range of needs—even for those die-hards (like us) who want to shift gears with the help of a clutch pedal."

They consistently have four-wheel drive, and were developed in the 1980s from the original Land Rover series which was launched at the Amsterdam Motor Show in April 1948. Following the 1989 introduction of the Land Rover Discovery, the term 'Land Rover' became the name of a broader marque, and thus no longer worked as the name of a specific model; thus in 1990 Land Rover renamed the 90 and 110 as Defender 90 and Defender 110 respectively. The 127 became the Defender 130."

The namesake of the \"pony car\" automobile segment, the Mustang was developed as a highly styled line of sporty coupes and convertibles derived from existing model lines, initially distinguished by \"long hood, short deck\" proportions.Originally predicted to sell 100,000 vehicles yearly, the 1965 Mustang became the most successful vehicle launch since the 1927 Model A. Introduced on April 17, 1964 (16 days after the Plymouth Barracuda), over 400,000 units in its first year; the one-millionth Mustang was sold within two years of its launch. In August 2018, Ford produced the 10-millionth Mustang; matching the first 1965 Mustang, the vehicle was a 2019 Wimbledon White convertible with a V8 engine."

Want to off-road anywhere between the Pacific Coast Highway and the Appalachians? The Wrangler is the vehicle of choice. Ironically, that legendary off-road capability has also made it a popular vehicle in suburban areas where a drive-thru lane might be the most treacherous terrain to navigate. Also contributing to the 2023 Wrangler's appeal is its overwhelming customizability. You can get it with two or four doors and one of six engine options that run the gamut from a four-cylinder engine to a thumping V8. Oh, and you can still get one with a manual transmission. In short, the Wrangler offers something for everyone and is one of the few vehicles around that, straight off the showroom floor, can take you to some of the most remote locations in the country."

      "description": "From the Toyota RAV4 Adventure to the Honda Passport TrailSport and Chevrolet Trailblazer Activ, the big trend these days is a crossover that looks like it has off-road ability — even if that's not necessarily the case. But what if you actually do need an SUV that can crawl over rocks, traverse muddy terrain and keep you riding high on the dunes? You might want to consider the 2023 Ford Bronco. Now in its third year of production, the new Bronco is a truck-based SUV that's designed for off-roading. It's got four-wheel drive, plenty of ground clearance, and many available hardware add-ons to keep you moving over rough terrain. It even has a removable roof and doors, so you can drive topless for that extra bit of sunshine while on the street or tackling a trail."

      "description": "In the EV space, there are cars that offer more performance and others that offer more range, but few deliver a balance of those two key attributes like the Mach-E. The wagon-like Ford SUV gets up to 314 miles of range and hits 60 mph in 5.2 seconds in all-wheel-drive trim. It's also pleasant to drive around town thanks to a suspension that does an excellent job absorbing bumps in the road and a cabin that isolates road noise remarkably well. The Mustang Mach-E belongs to a class that continues to grow each year, and today includes competitors like the  Bolt EUV,  Ioniq 5, Kia EV6,  Model Y,  ID.4 and  XC40 Recharge. Take a look at our Expert Rating to see how the Mustang Mach-E compares to its all-electric rivals."

      "description": "The 2022 Ford Escape is a small SUV that sits in a sweet spot between the automaker's smaller Ford EcoSport and larger Ford Edge and three-row Explorer. It competes in one of the most hotly contested segments around, with rivals including the  CR-V,  Cherokee,  CX-5 and  RAV4. The Escape was fully redesigned just a couple of years ago, which explains the lack of changes or upgrades for the 2022 model. The Escape does a lot of other things right. Its cabin is comfortable and spacious, and it's available with lots of technology and advanced driver aids. And although its cargo area isn't class-leading, what is here is right on the mark for what we expect from small SUVs. Less appealing is how the Escape drives. Essentially, we expect a little more refinement and handling precision. Learn more about our test team's findings by reading our Expert Rating on the 2022 Escape."

      "description": "The 2022 Honda Civic is the latest iteration of one of the best-selling vehicles on the road today. Available as both a sedan and hatchback, the 11th-generation Civic moves into its second year with at least one big change: the return of the hatchback-only Civic Type R. You can read everything we know in detail on our dedicated Civic Type R page. Otherwise, there aren't many changes to the Civic overall, though Honda has axed the previous base trim, the LX, from the lineup. New buyers looking for an affordable compact will now begin at the pricier Sport trim level — the only Civic with a non-turbocharged engine. Even though it's more expensive than before, the Civic is still a great all-around small sedan that easily satisfies."

Just about everything is a recent addition, including the extra-small Venue and three-row Palisade, or has been redesigned. Now, for 2022, it's the Tucson's turn. This is Hyundai's small SUV that competes against the likes of the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. The automaker has historically played things safe and stuck to conservative styling conventions, but not with the 2022 Tucson. The newly redesigned 2022 Tucson is offered with a standard gasoline engine, a regular hybrid powertrain and a plug-in hybrid powertrain, which is the one we're covering here. Thanks to the combined effort of a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder and an electric motor, the Tucson Plug-in Hybrid boasts a total output of 261 horsepower, making it the most powerful Tucson in the lineup."

      "description": "The Ford Explorer is one of the longest-running SUVs on the road. It debuted more than 30 years ago and kick-started an American love affair with sport-utility vehicles that persists to this day. Our editors have praised the current-generation Explorer for its powerful engines, generous cargo space and standard safety features. However, its subpar interior materials don't often match up to its price tag, which can get into luxury SUV territory on higher trim levels. While we find aspects of the Explorer appealing, the crop of midsize SUVs has grown significantly since the SUV debuted, and it is no longer the class leader it once was. The Kia Telluride and its corporate cousin, the Hyundai Palisade, have taken the top spots for our recommendations in recent years. Both are more comfortable and feel more premium inside than the Explorer, and each gets a refresh for the 2022 model year. A redesigned 2022 Honda Pilot is rolling out, too, and the lineup includes a new TrailSport version that offers improved off-roading capability."

Over the years it has built a fiercely loyal following, and the Tacoma can be uniquely customized thanks to what seems like an infinite number of aftermarket products. This is a tough truck with impressive off-road capability and is a manageable size if you don't want a full-size truck. Rumors of a fully redesigned Tacoma for 2022 have proven untrue, so it continues in much the same form as last year. The only additions include two appearance packages that dress up the SR5 trim with either black or chrome embellishments. Other changes amount to increased availability of a few minor features. These include a larger touchscreen, keyless entry and a power driver's seat. "

      "description": "Toyota's Highlander is one of the most well-known three-row midsize SUVs around. It's a great choice for growing families and offers versatility similar to a minivan but is more enjoyable to drive and easier to maneuver in most cases. The 2022 Highlander is based on the most recent generation Highlander that debuted in 2020 and receives some updates this year. Most notably, Toyota has dropped the Highlander's previous V6 engine in favor of a new turbocharged four-cylinder. It's down on horsepower compared to its predecessor but makes more torque. The new engine feels more substantial than you'd expect from a smaller four-cylinder engine in a vehicle this large. Power delivery is smooth, and the engine and eight-speed automatic transmission work in harmony to respond quickly to throttle inputs and get the SUV up to speed easily. The new four-cylinder engine also gets slightly higher EPA-estimated fuel economy than the old V6, helping to make this one of more fuel-efficient three-rows on the market. But it's also a lot noisier than the old V6 when you accelerate aggressively, and that can get annoying."

      "description": "Competing with the best small luxury sport sedans from Europe, the 2022 Lexus IS 350 doesn't look, feel or drive like it's based on the car's last redesign that happened way back in 2014. That's largely due to a major update for the 2021 model year when Lexus restyled the exterior, tightened up the handling, made the infotainment system easier to use, and upgraded the safety features. There are still some legacy elements that belie the car's age. One of them is its 311-horsepower V6 engine, which is underpowered compared to most of the upgraded six-cylinder engines found on rival sedans.  M340i version of the 3 Series, for instance, makes 382 hp plus considerably more torque. But on the whole there's a lot to like about the 2022 IS 350.

      "description": "Mercedes-Benz has discontinued the AMG GT coupe and convertible for 2022, leaving the sedan as the sole offering. The sedan — Mercedes calls it a four-door coupe, just so you know — gets a further paring down, with the high-performance GT 63 S trim getting the ax, at least for the initial part of the model year. There is a possibility that it will return later for 2022 if Mercedes can sort out the supply chain issues that have made it difficult to build the V8s found in its various AMG 63 trim vehicles. There's still plenty to like about what's left for the 2022 AMG GT. This \"four-door coupe\" takes the aggressive styling and low-slung coupe shape of the AMG GT sports car and incorporates it into a sedan body. It comes in two flavors for 2022: GT 43 and GT 53. Both are enjoyable to drive thanks to smooth power and plenty of available luxury features."

      "description": "Serving as Jaguar's best-selling model, the 2022 F-Pace is a midsize SUV equipped with seating for five people and offering all of the luxury, technology and performance you might want in a stylish and upscale crossover. It is one of three SUVs in the Jaguar lineup, bigger than the E-Pace, priced beneath the electric I-Pace, and more diverse than either of its siblings. Jaguars are all about style and design, and these traits largely define the 2022 F-Pace. It is one of the more attractive vehicles in its class, and like so many Jags of the past, the F-Pace is aging gracefully. Plus, it is sized in a sweet spot between typical compact and midsize luxury SUVs, making it appealing to people who want a little extra passenger and cargo room without much added bulk."

But this super SUV backs up its flamboyance with stunning performance and luxury. It merges an unabashedly  driving experience — including thumbs-up from onlookers — with advanced, problem-free technology that you don't usually get with a small-volume automaker. Brash and fast, or quiet and refined, at the driver's whim, the Urus is the ultimate performance SUV. The 2022 Lamborghini Urus is an exotic high-performance SUV. When it comes to carrying people and cargo, it doesn't get much faster than this. A powerful V8, sport-tuned suspension and a sophisticated all-wheel-drive system that works wonders at managing traction make the Urus feel like a true Lamborghini. The Urus' interior and exterior design draws a lot of influence from other  models, especially the Huracan, so it looks like one, too."

The new interior will likely divide opinion, but Porsche's push for modernity has been largely successful. Though it may have lost its evocative sound, the 911 hasn't lost its benchmark status. It's difficult to think of a sports car without picturing the iconic Porsche 911. A lot of that can be attributed to the 911's history of gradual evolution instead of being completely re-imagined with every generation. As a result, today's 2022 Porsche 911 is as recognizable as one from 1964."

Also, lacking many of the voice commands through Hey Mercedes again due to the chip shortage. All in all, the car rides beautifully and the seats are very comfortable. The engive seems a little loud but noise is minimal.",

Like the regular gas-powered Kona, the Electric boasts nimble feel around turns and quick steering. Plus, its electric motor makes it downright quick — just step on it and go. As for value, the Kona Electric presents a more budget-friendly way to go electric than many of the larger electric vehicles on the market. The Kona Electric gets its first major update since its debut in 2019, as does the rest of the Kona lineup for 2022. Up front the faux grille is gone, giving the nose a much sleeker appearance to go along with new LED daytime running light and headlight designs. The taillights and rear bumper have also been reworked, though the Kona Electric's overall shape remains the same."

The main complaint that came through those reviews is that the car doesn’t handle sharp enough or accelerate enough with blistering speed.  Ok maybe so when compared to a V6  or the like but enough is plenty enough.  I put 1,000 miles on it this first week.  It’s a great highway cruiser and handles nicely on back roads.  It’s quiet and smooth and inspires confidence. ",

Blessed with distinctive style, fantastic comfort, available all-wheel drive and a roomy cargo area, this full-size family hauler is an SUV for people who don't want to drive an SUV. Plus, VW has had the Arteon on a near continuous program of improvement since it first went on sale for 2019. That's especially true this year. The 2022 Volkswagen Arteon gets a handful of meaningful changes that make it better than ever. For starters, the car's appealing R-Line design treatment is now standard equipment, accompanied by a new wheel design in base SE R-Line trim. The SEL R-Line adds standard all-wheel drive for 2022, along with a new 20-inch wheel option. But the big news is an engine and transmission swapped in from the racy Volkswagen Golf R."

      "description": "The 2023 Mazda CX-50 is an all-new small SUV that is sold alongside the existing CX-5. It's an odd situation having two similar SUVs competing in the same class, but there are enough differences to justify each. You'll notice it on the outside, as the CX-50 has a slightly more rugged look by way of its more pronounced fenders and slimmer grille. Pleasingly, it's not all for show — the CX-50 offers improved off-road and towing capabilities compared to the CX-5 and many other rival SUVs as well. Much of the CX-50's adventure abilities can be attributed to the off-road drive mode that cleverly combines the steering and traction control systems to keep the vehicle on its intended path with ease. Depending on the trim level, the CX-50 also has either 8.3 or 8.6 inches of ground clearance; the latter figure is comparable to the outdoorsy Subaru Forester's (8.7 inches). There's also the CX-50 Meridian Edition that adds all-terrain tires."

Despite its petite dimensions, the UX makes a bold statement with a design highlighted by sharp lines and deep creases. The UX also impresses with its interior, which features high-quality materials and an attractive dashboard layout. Sitting at the bottom of Lexus hierarchy, you might expect the UX to be light on feature content. But even in base form, the UX 200 comes standard with dual-zone climate control, a Wi-Fi hotspot, adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist and blind-spot monitoring. That positions it well against entry-level luxury competitors like the GLB and  X1, though it is lacking in interior space compared to those two. See how the Lexus UX 200 stacks up in our Expert Rating below."

The Volkswagen also doesn't handle curves and corners as sharply as its sporty styling suggests. You'll need to decide if the trade-offs are worth it.  Fortunately you won't need to compromise fuel efficiency. The CC returns an EPA-estimated 25 mpg combined (22 city/31 hwy). In our testing, we managed 25.1 mpg in overall driving and 26.2 mpg on our mixed highway-mountain driving test loop. Those are decent numbers but others, such as the Honda Accord, achieve better."

This popular midsize luxury car gained new looks and updated engines during its 2021 refresh, and we liked the result enough that the E-Class earned the Edmunds Top Rated Luxury Sedan award. This year the E-Class would have won again were it not for a technicality — it lost out to its completely redesigned big brother, the larger S-Class. Not to worry. The 2022 E-Class is still plenty appealing. You can choose an E-Class as a sedan, which is the most popular, but there's also a coupe, a convertible and even a wagon, which is somehow both dorky and cool at the same time. All come with a richly appointed interior and top-notch refinement, and you can further layer on added performance and technological wizardry to your heart's (and budget's) content."

For 2022, Volvo added a mild hybrid system to the base turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. The new designation for the engine is B5 (it was formally T5). The supercharged and turbocharged T6 engine is no longer available, but the top plug-in hybrid Recharge T8 engine is still an option. Notably, Volvo is updating the Recharge T8 midway through the model year with a higher-capacity battery and a more powerful rear electric motor. The combination provides more power — a heady 455 horsepower — plus the ability to drive farther on all-electric power. The EPA estimates the updated version can go up to 41 miles on a charge, which is pretty impressive for a luxury plug-in hybrid."

The thing rockets around corners when you ask it to, but it's gentle as a bunny when you don't.  Our other car is a Dodge Challenger with a 6-speed manual transmission...except for the growl of the American brute, the Swede is as much fun to drive and way better at staying stuck to the road in hard corners thanks to the AWD.  This is a good looking car as well.  Big and strong.",

      "description": "With its largest and most expensive sedan, Volvo goes its own way. The 2023 Volvo S90 doesn't try to match established competitors from  with regard to power, performance and prestige. Instead, the S90 is a stately Scandinavian car with a simple, clean, uncluttered appearance and a focus on environmentalism and safety. Highlights include efficient electrified powertrains, impressive safety engineering and technology, excellent seat comfort, and a serene interior loaded with quality materials and approachable technology. Last year, Volvo added a new standard engine with a 48-volt mild hybrid system to improve efficiency and performance, and it upgraded the S90 Recharge model's plug-in hybrid powertrain to deliver nearly double the electric driving range before it switches to gas operation. Volvo also improved its infotainment system with Google-based features and an updated interface. This year, the familiar Momentum, R-Design and Inscription trim levels are gone, replaced by Plus and Ultimate trims, each paired with a Bright exterior treatment of chrome and metallic accents."

And what better way is there to celebrate the final years of the internal combustion engine than by making a supercharged V8 standard equipment on all models of the slinky 2022 Jaguar F-Type sports car? This year, Jaguar drops the F-Type's four-cylinder and six-cylinder engines in favor of a less powerful version of the F-Type R's mighty V8. The new model designation is P450, and it signals a supercharged V8 producing 444 horsepower and 428 lb-ft of torque. It is available with rear- or all-wheel-drive and in coupe and convertible body styles. Regardless of the configuration, Jaguar says the new 2022 F-Type P450 accelerates to 60 mph in 4.4 seconds and reaches a top speed of 177 mph."

      "description": "Audi's all-electric e-tron lineup consists of mostly SUVs and one car: the e-tron GT. It's a powerful sport sedan with a striking design that's closely related to its electric cousin, the Porsche Taycan. Its dual-motor layout provides all-wheel-drive traction and can produce up to 522 horsepower. The e-tron GT has an EPA-estimated driving range of 238 miles, which is relatively low, but in our real-world range test it drove 273 miles. For additional power and performance, Audi offers the RS e-tron GT, which we review separately. Most of the e-tron GT's 2023 updates are minor revisions to its standard features and optional packages, but there are some notable changes. The previous black grille has been replaced by a body-colored one and a Bang & Olufsen audio system is now standard on all trim levels. Also, a second charging port (for Level 1 and 2 charging) has been added to the passenger side of the e-tron GT."

      "description": "There aren't many electric SUVs on the market, but the ones that exist are all pretty darn good. That's certainly the case with the Audi e-tron Sportback, which boasts a smooth ride, impeccable cabin materials and plenty of premium features among its positive attributes. This Sportback is the sporty-looking version of the regular all-electric e-tron SUV. Its sloping rear roofline adds style, but you sacrifice a little cargo space and rear headroom in the process. Audi is further enhancing the e-tron Sportback's appeal for 2022 with a new performance-oriented e-tron S Sportback. The e-tron S has an additional motor, bringing the total to three for this all-wheel-drive SUV. Combined output is 429 horsepower, which can be temporarily increased to 496 hp. Audi estimates that the e-tron S Sportback can sprint from 0 to 60 mph in 4.3 seconds using launch control. (The standard 355-hp model does 0-60 mph in as little as 5.5 seconds.)"

      "description": "The Nissan Leaf isn't as cool as a and doesn't offer the latest in EV tech, but it's one of the longest-running EVs on the road, offering an affordable and practical option for people wanting to drive a zero-emission vehicle. It was quietly strutting its kilowatts on the streets before any Tesla rolled out of the factory and showed there was an interest in EVs even though it sported a strange look and a short driving range. The current second-generation Leaf matured with more traditional styling and a longer driving range. Nissan updated the 2023 Leaf with a restyled front end and reduced the number of trims offered. You'll probably have to squint your eyes to see the revised grille, front bumper and headlights that have a darker housing. But the illuminated Nissan badge on the grille is easier to spot at night. The Leaf is now only offered in two models: the base Leaf S, which has a smaller battery pack and shorter driving range, and the Leaf SV Plus, which is offered with a larger battery pack and longer driving range. The larger battery pack provides a driving range of 215 miles, but the 2022 model we tested drove 237 miles."

Dealership wanted to charge me $200 for a diagnostic test which I did not do.  After much researching, there are numerous complaints about the same problem for this specific year and model.  The reason it's significant is because after the release of this new model there was a low number of vehicles imported into this country and Mitsubishi has not done a recall.

      "description": "The Eclipse Cross is Mitsubishi's compact SUV that sits between the smaller Outlander Sport and larger Outlander. Just introduced in 2018, it's a relatively new competitor in the crowded SUV segment. It skipped the 2021 model year and received a refresh for 2022. It's unique and bold-looking, but even with its updates, the Eclipse Cross falls behind its rivals in most categories. Mitsubishi updated the front and rear ends of the Eclipse Cross for 2022. Up front, it receives a revised bumper, grille and headlights, and its rear end sports a redesigned hatch and new rear window. The odd split rear window design is now a single window. Inside, the Eclipse Cross gets a new available 8-inch infotainment system touchscreen display. It's positioned closer to the driver and now includes volume and tuning knobs instead of the fussy buttons on the previous version. Lastly, Mitsubishi retuned the SUV's suspension for improved ride comfort and handling."

I rented a Tahoe during a ski trip so decided to switch because I could not take the clicking. Even test drove a 2021 AMG GLE 63 and it had a click as well. I have kids and always had a Van due to it carries people and bags but the Cadillac has more room behind the 3rd row seat than the previous model. Still not as much as a Van but close enough. The Cadillac is not as luxurious as the GLS but it has quite and very smooth ride. If it holds up over time I will consider it a much better option than the GLS.  ",

      "description": "More than two decades after its debut, the Cadillac Escalade remains a modern icon. Its sharp creases, undeniable presence, strong V8 power and robust towing ability have made it a fixture in both pop culture and suburban driveways. Fully redesigned last year, the 2022 Escalade carries over its winning formula, with only minor changes to driver aids and safety features. This new-generation Escalade is longer than its predecessor, making for even more passenger room in its second and third rows. A new independent suspension design replaces the old solid-axle configuration, helping the Escalade feel less like a luxury truck and more like a proper executive-class ride. Cadillac's Super Cruise semi-automated driving system reinforces the feeling with a nearly hands- and feet-free cruise control experience ideal for taming the stress of crowded highway commutes."

      "description": "The 2022 Land Rover Range Rover Sport is a midsize luxury SUV. It slots between the full-size Range Rover and the smaller, sleeker Range Rover Evoque in Land Rover's lineup. The current-generation Range Rover Sport dates back to 2014, but Land Rover has made enough rolling updates over the years to largely keep pace with the competition. The Range Rover Sport has a lot of competition in the market. Some of our favorite midsize luxury SUVs include the  Q8,  X5,  GLE and  Cayenne. Compared to those rivals, the Range Rover Sport is a step or two behind in terms of comfort and technology features. It's also somewhat more expensive, though you do get respectable off-road capability as part of the deal. Overall, the Range Rover Sport isn't our top pick for a midsize SUV, but it has a certain charm that's hard to replicate elsewhere."

      "description": "Alfa Romeo is nothing if not passionate, and among small luxury SUVs, the 2022 Stelvio is one of the most adept at kindling your driving spirit. Rewarding driving dynamics are baked into every version of the Stelvio, which wears a distinctive look that sets it further apart from its rivals. Whether you see it or hear it before driving it, you know the Stelvio is different. And when you get behind the wheel, this Alfa Romeo's primary purpose is obvious. It exists to give you a thrill, especially in downright riotous Quadrifoglio specification. There are penalties to be paid for the Stelvio's exciting driving dynamics and dapper Italian design. The cargo area is relatively small, though this is a matter of perspective. Compared to SUVs with pronounced coupe-like styling, the Stelvio suffers no utility penalty. It also doesn't look particularly luxurious from the driver's seat, a function of its driver-focused purpose. Some competitors also offer more sophisticated technologies. But if you're a driving enthusiast with a strong sense of individualism and you'd rather not own the same compact luxury SUV everyone else does, the 2022 Alfa Romeo Stelvio is sure to please."

      "description": "Dodge's big muscle car is a hoot to drive, even if it doesn't feel quite as sharp as the Chevrolet Camaro or Ford Mustang. Of the three, the 2022 Challenger is the most old-school, which makes sense since the design dates to 2008, which itself recalls the Challengers from the early 1970s. This is a big, heavy coupe that feels big and heavy from behind the wheel. Thankfully, there's a diverse selection of available V8 engines that are more than capable of imparting this big coupe with rapid straight-line velocity. Or just big smoky burnouts if that's more your thing. The Challenger comes with a standard V6, but it's the SRT and supercharged Hellcat engines that will blast you down the local drag strip with joyful abandon."

      "description": "The classic two-door hardtop is likely what comes to mind when you think of Mini, but the brand has other models to satisfy different needs. One of those is the Mini Clubman, a wagon-like variant with rear barn doors instead of a traditional hatch. With four side doors and a low, boxy cargo area, the Clubman offers more practicality than a classic Mini yet maintains a healthy dose of fun. Even in base form, the Clubman feels nimble and sprightly thanks to its turbocharged four-cylinder that makes 189 horsepower. If you need more grip, all-wheel drive is available in the Clubman All4. Like other Minis, the Clubman features upscale materials in its cabin, helping it stand apart from other compact hatchbacks. Despite its premium nature, the Mini Clubman still competes against small cars from mainstream brands, including the Hyundai Veloster and Volkswagen Golf GTI. "

Now in its third decade of production, the BMW X5 is currently one of the most compelling choices in the midsize luxury SUV segment. Every version offers impressive acceleration, a wealth of technology features, and a spacious, comfortable cabin. You can even add a third-row seat to the X5. It's good in a pinch, but if you consistently require seven-passenger capacity, we recommend getting the larger BMW X7. This year, the 2022 BMW X5 carries over with minimal changes beyond the arrival of an opulent Black Vermilion version of the xDrive40i. Available for just one year, the X5 Black Vermilion pairs plush equipment with flashy styling inside and out. Overall the X5 is a solid choice for a luxury SUV among rivals such as the  MDX,  Q7,  GV80 and  GLE. Be sure to read our Expert Rating of the BMW X5 to learn more about this appealing SUV. "

      "description": "It's difficult to call a car costing upward of $160,000 entry-level, but in the case of the 2022 Aston Martin Vantage, it's appropriate. That's mostly because it's the smallest and least expensive vehicle in the Aston Martin lineup. Compared to more mass-produced sport coupes, the Vantage boasts strong but not awe-inspiring performance. It has a 503-horsepower turbocharged V8 sourced from Mercedes and sharp handling that should thrill most drivers. So what do you get for the money? The Vantage exudes an air of exclusivity that no brand can invent overnight. Given Aston Martin's extensive customization options, you are all but guaranteed to configure a one-of-a-kind model. What you don't get is also worth noting. The suspension favors handling over comfort, so don't expect a luxurious ride. Don't expect many of the latest technology features either since the infotainment system is pulled from the previous-generation Mercedes parts bin. "

I did alot of research and it came down to the Giulia against the Chrysler 300, VW Arteon, Kia Stinger, Genesis G70, Sonata N-Line, Acura TLX and Nissan Maxima. Test drove all of them and the Giulia was the clear winner in terms of handling, design and uniqueness. I bought a Misano blue TI AWD and it gets looks everywhere I go. It's an amazing car to drive and I have absolutely zero buyer's remorse. The trunk space is on the smaller side as is the backseat but as a single guy who doesn't have kids, neither of those are major concerns for me. If you are looking for a car in this class, buy one, you won't regret it. ",

      "description": "Do you yearn to drive something different? Most small luxury sedans these days can seem pretty cookie-cutter. Enter the 2022 Alfa Romeo Giulia, a small luxury sedan with distinctive styling, athletic reflexes and an interior that feels like a tailored suit for the driver. Compared to something like an  A4 or  3 Series, the Alfa Romeo Giulia stands out in a crowd. Giulia sales are comparatively small too, furthering the car's exclusive vibe. The base Giulia comes with a 280-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder engine and is fun and lively to drive. And if you want to take that special feeling to the next level, there's the top-of-the-line Quadrifoglio, with its 505-horsepower V6. The Giulia isn't without its faults — take a look at our Expert Rating to read our in-depth analysis — but its personality is a perfect antidote to small luxury sedan blandness."

      "description": "The 2022 Q8 is a midsize two-row model with seating for five people that sits at the top of the Audi SUV lineup. It is based on the Audi Q7, but it has a more stylish and sporty design and eliminates the Q7's third-row seat. The Q8 blends high-quality materials with high-tech displays to create a premium interior look and feel. Quick acceleration, standard all-wheel drive and a comfortable ride make the Q8 enjoyable to drive too. The Q8 competes against other coupe-style SUVs such as the  X6,  GLE Coupe and  Cayenne Coupe. And if you want a Q8 with more performance, the V8-powered SQ8 and RS Q8 are hugely entertaining and fare well against performance SUVs from  and  M performance division. Overall the Audi Q8 is one of the more practical SUV coupes on sale today, striking a good balance between style and utility and making it one of our favorite luxury SUVs. For more details, be sure to read our full Expert Rating of the 2022 Audi Q8."

      "description": "For years, enthusiasts clamored for a truck version of the venerable Jeep Wrangler. A few years back, the automaker finally obliged. The 2022 Jeep Gladiator is a crew-cab pickup truck with a 5-foot cargo bed and more off-road prowess than most other vehicles you'll find on the road. From the front seats forward, the Gladiator looks and feels nearly identical to the Wrangler it's based on. And as with the Wrangler, you can remove the Gladiator's roof to get a full in-the-sun motoring experience. Sounds great, right? Well, it is until it's not. The Gladiator also shares many of the Wrangler's downsides, including a noisy interior on the highway and a jiggly ride. In comparison, the Honda Ridgeline is a lot more practical and sensible, while the  Colorado and  Tacoma give you a balanced combo of comfort and off-road capability. Which truck should you get? Check out our test team's Expert Rating of the Gladiator to help you decide."

      "description": "The 2022 Mercedes-Benz S-Class is coming off a successful redesign introduced last year. It improved on the old model in just about every area, from in-car technology features to on-road performance. Given that this is basically still an all-new model, we don't expect any significant changes for 2022, though Mercedes' E-Active Body Control adaptive suspension should be available as an option. This is a special suspension that proactively leans the car into a turn, creating extraordinary body stability. We think the S-Class is one of the best cars on the road today. But there are a few rival sedans worth looking at, especially given the Mercedes' sizable price tag. The  7 Series has long gone head-to-head with the S-Class. Other rivals include the Audi A8, Genesis G90, Lexus LS and Porsche Panamera. All start significantly less than the S-Class, though options quickly add up, especially on the Audi,  and Porsche. Still, Mercedes captures something with the S-Class that can't quite be replicated elsewhere. Check out our test team's full Expert Rating to learn more."

      "description": "If we asked you to picture in your mind a midsize luxury sedan, odds are it looks something like the Mercedes-Benz E-Class or  5 Series. But if you're not one to follow the crowd, you might be thinking of the Maserati Ghibli, the uniquely Italian alternative to the usual four-door suspects from Germany.  The 2022 Maserati Ghibli tackles the midsize luxury sedan equation in its own way, with a focus on performance that's conveyed through its aggressively styled front end. Though the Ghibli can be had with exceptionally supple leather upholstery and plush materials, in general its interior fit and finish isn't on the same level as the Germans, with some bland-looking controls and lackluster design elements making it feel less special than its competitors. But if you can get past that, the Ghibli is a comfortable and fun-to-drive luxury sedan, especially in Trofeo guise, which competes with the likes of the  M5 and Mercedes-AMG E 63. If you're looking for something different, read our in-depth Expert Rating to see if the Maserati Ghibli is for you."

      "description": "The phrase \"game changer\" gets used a lot, and oftentimes it comes wrapped up with a lot of hyperbole. But the 2022 Rivian R1T is indeed a game changer. It's the first vehicle from this American startup automaker, and it's also the first fully electric pickup truck to hit the market, beating both the  F-150 Lightning and  Cybertruck to public streets. As you might imagine, the R1T is no ordinary pickup. For one, this all-electric machine has four motors, one for each wheel. And its performance specs are impressive. It's built to tow as much as 11,000 pounds. And when it is empty, it can accelerate to 60 mph in about 3.5 seconds or cruise more than 300 miles on a full charge. Want to go off-road? There's plenty of clearance to avoid rocks and ruts thanks to short body overhangs, a smooth underbody, and a height-adjustable suspension that allows you to raise the body of the truck when desired."

Wow, was I wrong with my intial thoughts. The look is aggressive with its wide stance and multiple angles...pictures definitely don't do it justice.  I had to purchase it before driving it, but am exceptionally happy with the performance. All the positive reviews can be trusted. The GTR moves out like nothing I have driven before (coming out of a  RS4). Its acceleration and cornering ability are amazing for such a large heavy car.

      "description": "The Nissan GT-R has been one of the fastest performance cars in the world for more than a decade. However, it's also been pretty much the same that whole time; it debuted for the 2009 model year and hasn't received a full redesign since. Nissan has done its best to make updates at least. The only notable differences for 2021 is the elimination of the Track edition model and the return of the iconic Bayside Blue paint color made famous on the R34-generation Nissan Skyline GT-R from the late 1990s (a car that unfortunately was never sold new in America). As fast and as powerful as the GT-R still is, it doesn't feel quite as outlandish as it used to. Rivals such as the  R8,  GT and  offer similar levels of performance but with a wider array of features and a more refined driving experience. Then again, the GT-R's age could be seen as a charming rebuke to ever-advancing technology in cars. Read our Expert Rating below to get our full take on the 2023 GT-R."

The seven-seat Aviator made its return in 2020 after an absence of several years, with an all-new design, powertrains, in-car tech and advanced driver aids. It quickly became one of our favorite vehicles in the segment. It has a look and feel you won't find anywhere else in the class. The cabin is comfortable and extremely well appointed, with lots of premium touches that make it stand out in a competitive class. We also like the powerful turbocharged engine and the available plug-in hybrid powertrain."

      "description": "Since its introduction, the Bentayga has been able to flaunt exclusivity and status in equal measure, making it the preeminent ultra-luxury SUV. Though it shares its underpinnings with the likes of the  Urus and the  Cayenne, the Bentayga is very much a Bentley and, as such, can be built to suit even the most extravagant and unique tastes. Powering this bespoke behemoth is your choice of either a twin-turbocharged V8 or an exotic twin-turbocharged V12 engine. A plug-in hybrid powertrain was offered last year, but Bentley has put this option on hiatus until 2023."

      "description": "The Kia Stinger is a sporty sedan that helped redefine what Kia stands for. There haven't been a lot of updates since its debut in 2018, but that all changes with the 2022 model year. First up is a new turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine. It produces 300 horsepower and 311 lb-ft of torque. That's almost 50 hp more than last year and similar to what you might typically get from an upgraded performance engine in a midsize sedan such as Kia's K5. Oh, and the Stinger offers its own performance upgrade too: a 368-hp turbocharged V6, which gets a sportier exhaust sound for 2022"

Though the automaker's website currently restricts Model Y orders to those of the $54,380 Long Range or $58,380 Performance variants, Tesla's list of online inventory shows that a number of its stores are stocked with salable base Model Y EVs that wear a starting price $2000 less than that of the Long Range model. (As of this writing, however, it seems most of these entry-level Ys in inventory include at least $2000 worth of optional 20-inch wheels and tires, thus effectively negating the base model's cost savings over its Long Range counterpart.) .",

It also packs a greater EPA-rated range relative to its single-motor forebear. With up to 279 miles of driving range on a full charge, the cheapest Model Y variant betters the old Standard Range model's range by 35 miles. That said, it falls short of the Model Y Long Range and Performance's figures by up to 51 and 24 miles, respectively",

Michael Pevovar, the director of the affordable EV design studio, told reporters that the vehicles in development, including the new tiny pickup, are \"to get a reaction\" to what does and doesn't work for vehicles being considered for production, according to Auto News. Pevovar further elaborated that the concept could get bigger if it's determined to be too small, given the flexibility of the scalable Ultium battery-based platform.",
