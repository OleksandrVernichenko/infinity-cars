The Model S was officially announced on June 30, 2008, and a prototype vehicle was unveiled in March 2009. The Model S debuted on June 22, 2012. A revised, dual-motor, all-wheel-drive version, known as the 60D, debuted on October 9, 2014. The 60D was followed by the 70D, which made dual-motor and all-wheel drive the standard, followed by the 85D, P85D, and P90D. Along with these updates, Tesla offered the Autopilot driving assistance system. In April 2016, the Model S was updated with a new front hood design. In October of the same year, hardware became standard that supports Tesla's Full Self Driving (FSD) capability. As part of the update, integrated standard cameras around the car were added. In February 2017 the Tesla Model S P100D debuted, which included a revised motor and was the first electric vehicle to have an EPA estimated range exceeding 300 miles (483 km). A refresh of the Tesla Model S, codenamed \"Palladium\", was introduced in June 2021, offering a new \"Plaid\" performance model, along with a revised interior, powertrain, and suspension."

      "description": "The 2022 Audi S5 Sportback looks great, goes fast, and carves corners as well as today's best sports sedans, but its anodyne driving persona lacks some of the charm and drama we look for in a performance car. Under the hood is a perky 349-hp turbocharged V-6 that sends its power through an eight-speed automatic down to the ground through standard Quattro all-wheel drive. Handling is lithe, and the S5 Sportback is easy to hustle down a twisty road.  Displacing 3.0 liters, the turbo V-6 is more powerful and torquier than the supercharged engine that came in the last-generation S5. It accelerates rapidly from a stop, and overtaking other drivers on the highway is effortless. While it trails the Mercedes-AMG C43's 4.1-second zero-to- 60 mph time, the last S5 model we tested still managed an impressive 4.3-second sprint. The EPA estimates the 2022 S5 Sportback will earn 21/30mpg city/highway. While we haven't tested a 2022 S5 Sportback on our real-world highway fuel-economy route, the last one we evaluated returned 33 mpg during that test."

Slotted above the Wildtrak appearance package, the Raptor is fitted with suspension and chassis upgrades to improve its off-road capability. In line with its F-150 namesake, the Raptor is fitted with a widened track and a raised ride height.The Ranger Raptor is fitted with a 2.0L EcoBlue biturbo diesel engine, producing 210 hp. Shared with globally-marketed versions of the Ford Transit and the Ford Everest, the engine is coupled to a 10-speed automatic transmission (shared with the F-150, including the Raptor). Similar to F-150 Raptor, the four-wheel drive system of the Ranger Raptor is adaptable to terrain.While not wide enough to require clearance lights, the Ranger Raptor adopts several design elements of its F-150 counterpart, including gray six-spoke wheels, a FORD-lettered grille, and large Raptor decals on the sides of the cargo bed."

That's exactly what tens of thousands (maybe more) of Jeep Wrangler owners have been doing for nearly four decades to get the Wrangler of their dreams. What is that dream Wrangler, you ask? It's one with a V-8 engine under the hood. Jeep has never offered it as an option from its factory … until now. In grand fashion, Jeep chose not just any V-8 engine for its new 2022 Wrangler Rubicon 392, instead they grabbed the largest displacement engine in their catalog, the 6.4-liter HEMI V-8, and stuffed it between the Wrangler's fenders. When paired with the legendary off-road hardware of Jeep's Rubicon package, and the company's new Xtreme Recon package, it's not difficult to see how the Wrangler Rubicon 392 found itself on the top of our leaderboard, eventually taking home the title of the 2022 Four Wheeler SUV of the Year."

The styling of the original Supra was derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was both longer and wider.Starting in mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a separate model from the Celica. In turn, Toyota also stopped using the prefix Celica and named the car Supra. Owing to the similarity and past of the Celica's name, it is frequently mistaken for the Supra, and vice versa. The first, second and third generations of the Supra were assembled at the Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi, while the fourth generation was assembled at the Motomachi plant in Toyota City. The 5th generation of the Supra is assembled alongside the G29 BMW Z4 in Graz, Austria by Magna Steyr."

The Bronco comes in both two- and four-door body styles, and it was designed to do everything a Wrangler can—and it does that and more. Yes, you can remove the doors on the Bronco just like you can on a Wrangler but only the Ford retains its mirrors. Both brands’ SUVs cater to the big muddy but the Bronco suffers from noticeably less road noise when traveling the highways between puddles. It has more base horsepower too, with output ranging between a 300-hp turbocharged 2.3-liter inline-four and a 330-hp twin-turbo 2.7-liter V-6. If you’re after more than that, feast your eyes on the swollen fenders of the 418-hp Bronco Raptor, reviewed separately. With a dizzying array of models, trims, and optional equipment the Bronco offers vast configurability that allows it to fit a wide range of needs—even for those die-hards (like us) who want to shift gears with the help of a clutch pedal."

They consistently have four-wheel drive, and were developed in the 1980s from the original Land Rover series which was launched at the Amsterdam Motor Show in April 1948. Following the 1989 introduction of the Land Rover Discovery, the term 'Land Rover' became the name of a broader marque, and thus no longer worked as the name of a specific model; thus in 1990 Land Rover renamed the 90 and 110 as Defender 90 and Defender 110 respectively. The 127 became the Defender 130."

Currently in its sixth generation, it is the fifth-best selling Ford car nameplate. The namesake of the \"pony car\" automobile segment, the Mustang was developed as a highly styled line of sporty coupes and convertibles derived from existing model lines, initially distinguished by \"long hood, short deck\" proportions.Originally predicted to sell 100,000 vehicles yearly, the 1965 Mustang became the most successful vehicle launch since the 1927 Model A. Introduced on April 17, 1964 (16 days after the Plymouth Barracuda), over 400,000 units in its first year; the one-millionth Mustang was sold within two years of its launch. In August 2018, Ford produced the 10-millionth Mustang; matching the first 1965 Mustang, the vehicle was a 2019 Wimbledon White convertible with a V8 engine."

That means a hot-rod version of the 2023 Mustang GT, supercharged to make 750 horsepower, barking exhaust fumes out of the Borla cat-back exhaust system. Fittingly, Shelby American is only planning to make 100 of the centennial edition. Unfortunately they've all sold out in the four days since a prototype was displayed in Gardena, California.The Shelby American team isn't being too strict with this one. Want a fastback? Sure. Convertible? You got it. Manual transmission? Sign here. Automatic transmission? If you say so. What it won't stand for is non-stock Mustang colors, the Mach 1, or the California Special. Basically, as long as the badging reads \"GT\" and the title says 2023, you're in the clear.",

      "text": "Tesla's pulling a page from In-N-Out Burger's playbook and giving Model Y buyers the chance to order a cheaper variant off a proverbial secret menu. Though the automaker's website currently restricts Model Y orders to those of the $54,380 Long Range or $58,380 Performance variants, Tesla's list of online inventory shows that a number of its stores are stocked with salable base Model Y EVs that wear a starting price $2000 less than that of the Long Range model. (As of this writing, however, it seems most of these entry-level Ys in inventory include at least $2000 worth of optional 20-inch wheels and tires, thus effectively negating the base model's cost savings over its Long Range counterpart.) Unlike the prior entry-level rear-drive Model Y, which Tesla stopped producing in 2021, this new base-level Model Y comes standard with a dual-motor all-wheel-drive system. It also packs a greater EPA-rated range relative to its single-motor forebear. With up to 279 miles of driving range on a full charge, the cheapest Model Y variant betters the old Standard Range model's range by 35 miles. That said, it falls short of the Model Y Long Range and Performance's figures by up to 51 and 24 miles, respectively.",

Which last year was… drumroll please… the BMW i4 M50. Weren't expecting that, were you? A sure sign then, that customers have fully embraced BMW M’s march into electromobility, or just a sign that the M50 is a really very fast car with a BMW and M badge? Think you know the answer to that. And it is really very fast. There’s a twin-motor setup – one e-motor on the front axle, one on the back – powered by a 83.9kWh battery able to propel the four-door saloon from 0-62mph in just 3.9s. That’s exactly how long it takes the 503bhp BMW M3 to hit 62mph too.",

      "text": "Back in March 2020, General Motors CEO Mary Barra announced an array of all-new, all-electric vehicles were actively in development. Now, nearly two years later, GM has revealed an in-house design studio devoted to the development of next-gen Ultium EVs, one of which might be a compact all-electric pickup that's being actively worked on. A group of media including Automotive News were reportedly invited to a General Motors \"affordable EV design studio\" in Warren, Michigan, where it revealed a \"baby pickup\" said to be smaller than the compact Ford Maverick, among a room full of conceptual clay models. GM did not release any public images or details of the studio nor truck, but Auto News says marketing materials showed the pickup being used for recreational activities, like going to the beach to surf. Michael Pevovar, the director of the affordable EV design studio, told reporters that the vehicles in development, including the new tiny pickup, are \"to get a reaction\" to what does and doesn't work for vehicles being considered for production, according to Auto News. Pevovar further elaborated that the concept could get bigger if it's determined to be too small, given the flexibility of the scalable Ultium battery-based platform.  ",
